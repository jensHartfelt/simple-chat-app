      "I've used Vue.js for templating and i've been very generous with comments - so even if you haven't seen Vue before it should make some sense. Events are handled by @eventName as an attribute and conditions are handled by v-condition (v-if, v-else, v-for and so on). I know that you prefer minimalistic and simple solutions and i think you'll like vue quite a lot because of this. Also note that there are no build tools, no ES6, no fancy frontend state-management, no JSX - it's just html, css and js"
